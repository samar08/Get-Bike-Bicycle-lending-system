# Get-Bike-Bicycle-lending-system

Aim:
Many universities allow students to use bicycles on campus. There are different times when students need a bicycle. But not every student can afford to buy a new bicycle for a small want. So, there has to be a way for them to use a bicycle only whenever they need it. On the other hand, many other students own bicycles but do not use them at all times which is leading to the wastage of many bicycles. This project aims to solve these real-world problems by providing a platform for users to purchase or borrow bicycles from other students for some time.

Description:
This is an Android app where users(college students) who have a bicycle can sell or rent it to other users who want to buy it. It is built with multiple features like the users can book for an available bicycle based on their preferred date and time. The owners can add or delete their bicycles from the available list and specify when the bicycle will be available for other users to use. Also, the owners can view the list of user requests for their bicycles and choose which users they want to lend their bicycles to. The total cost of the booking will be automatically generated from the amount of time the user used the bicycle. Both the owners and users are enabled with the option to view their history of rides. Email-based authentication is added to confirm the identity of the user.
