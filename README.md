# Get-Bike-Bicycle-lending-system

Aim:
Many universities allow students to use bicycles on campus. There are different times where students need a bicycle. But not every student can afford to buy a new bicycle for a small want. So, there has to be a way for them to use a bicycle whenever they need it. On the other hand, there are many other students who owns a bicycle but not using them at all the time which is leading to the wastage of many bicycles. This project aims to solve these real world problems by providing a platform for users to purchase or borrow bicycles for a period of time.

Description:
This is an android app where the users who have a bicycle can sell or rent it to the customers who want to buy it. It is built with multiple features like the users can book for an available bicycle based on their preferred date and time. The owners can add or delete their bicycle from the available list of bicycles. The total cost of the booking will be automatically generated from the amount of time the user used the bicycle. Both the owners and users are enabled with the option to view their history of rides. Email based authentication is added to confirm the identity of the user.
